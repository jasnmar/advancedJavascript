/*
Challenge:
1. Using the code snippet in the slide, add a body 
   property to the object we are passing with the 
   fetch request. I want you to create a new post 
   with the title “Holiday Nightmares” and the body 
   “When I was kidnapped in Scotland…” 
   
   In the console, you should see and object with an 
   ID, for example: {id: 101}
